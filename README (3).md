# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition System

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** built using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning** techniques. It detects hand gestures from images or real-time webcam input and accurately classifies them into predefined gesture classes. The system enables natural and touchless interaction between humans and computers.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam
- High accuracy using CNN-based deep learning model
- Robust performance under different lighting conditions
- Easy to extend with new gestures
- Clean and modular project structure

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MediaPipe
- Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Collection of hand gestures  
2. Image Preprocessing and normalization  
3. Feature extraction using hand landmarks  
4. Model training using CNN  
5. Gesture prediction on live video stream  

## 🧪 Applications
- Sign Language Recognition  
- Touchless User Interfaces  
- Virtual Reality and Gaming  
- Smart Home Automation  
- Robotics Control  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the main application file  
4. Show gestures in front of the webcam  

## 📈 Results
- High classification accuracy
- Smooth real-time detection
- Low latency response

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Dynamic gesture recognition (LSTM / Transformer)
- Mobile and web app integration
- Multi-hand gesture support
